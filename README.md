I have developed a small application using openweathermap API with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will provide the live weather information to user. User can add any city or country name and get the weather forecast. I have deployed this with the help of Surge which is a static web publishing tool that allows us to quickly and easily deploy static websites to the web.
